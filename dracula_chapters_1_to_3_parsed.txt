 may bistritzleft munich at  p m on st may arriving at
vienna early next morning should have arrived at  but train was an
hour late budapesth seems a wonderful place from the glimpse which i
got of it from the train and the little i could walk through the
streets i feared to go very far from the station as we had arrived
late and would start as near the correct time as possible the
impression i had was that we were leaving the west and entering the
east the most western of splendid bridges over the danube which is
here of noble width and depth took us among the traditions of turkish
rule

we left in pretty good time and came after nightfall to klausenburgh
here i stopped for the night at the hotel royale i had for dinner or
rather supper a chicken done up some way with red pepper which was
very good but thirsty mem get recipe for mina i asked the
waiter and he said it was called paprika hendl and that as it was a
national dish i should be able to get it anywhere along the
carpathians i found my smattering of german very useful here indeed i
dont know how i should be able to get on without it

having had some time at my disposal when in london i had visited the
british museum and made search among the books and maps in the library
regarding transylvania it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the
country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a
nobleman of that country i find that the district he named is in the
extreme east of the country just on the borders of three states
transylvania moldavia and bukovina in the midst of the carpathian
mountains one of the wildest and least known portions of europe i was
not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the
castle dracula as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare
with our own ordnance survey maps but i found that bistritz the post
town named by count dracula is a fairly wellknown place i shall enter
here some of my notes as they may refresh my memory when i talk over my
travels with mina

in the population of transylvania there are four distinct nationalities
saxons in the south and mixed with them the wallachs who are the
descendants of the dacians magyars in the west and szekelys in the
east and north i am going among the latter who claim to be descended
from attila and the huns this may be so for when the magyars conquered
the country in the eleventh century they found the huns settled in it i
read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the
horseshoe of the carpathians as if it were the centre of some sort of
imaginative whirlpool if so my stay may be very interesting mem i
must ask the count all about them

i did not sleep well though my bed was comfortable enough for i had
all sorts of queer dreams there was a dog howling all night under my
window which may have had something to do with it or it may have been
the paprika for i had to drink up all the water in my carafe and was
still thirsty towards morning i slept and was wakened by the continuous
knocking at my door so i guess i must have been sleeping soundly then
i had for breakfast more paprika and a sort of porridge of maize flour
which they said was mamaliga and eggplant stuffed with forcemeat a
very excellent dish which they call impletata mem get recipe
for this also i had to hurry breakfast for the train started a little
before eight or rather it ought to have done so for after rushing to
the station at  i had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour
before we began to move it seems to me that the further east you go the
more unpunctual are the trains what ought they to be in china

all day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of
beauty of every kind sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the
top of steep hills such as we see in old missals sometimes we ran by
rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side
of them to be subject to great floods it takes a lot of water and
running strong to sweep the outside edge of a river clear at every
station there were groups of people sometimes crowds and in all sorts
of attire some of them were just like the peasants at home or those i
saw coming through france and germany with short jackets and round hats
and homemade trousers but others were very picturesque the women
looked pretty except when you got near them but they were very clumsy
about the waist they had all full white sleeves of some kind or other
and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something
fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet but of course there
were petticoats under them the strangest figures we saw were the
slovaks who were more barbarian than the rest with their big cowboy
hats great baggy dirtywhite trousers white linen shirts and enormous
heavy leather belts nearly a foot wide all studded over with brass
nails they wore high boots with their trousers tucked into them and
had long black hair and heavy black moustaches they are very
picturesque but do not look prepossessing on the stage they would be
set down at once as some old oriental band of brigands they are
however i am told very harmless and rather wanting in natural
selfassertion

it was on the dark side of twilight when we got to bistritz which is a
very interesting old place being practically on the frontierfor the
borgo pass leads from it into bukovinait has had a very stormy
existence and it certainly shows marks of it fifty years ago a series
of great fires took place which made terrible havoc on five separate
occasions at the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent
a siege of three weeks and lost  people the casualties of war
proper being assisted by famine and disease

count dracula had directed me to go to the golden krone hotel which i
found to my great delight to be thoroughly oldfashioned for of
course i wanted to see all i could of the ways of the country i was
evidently expected for when i got near the door i faced a
cheerylooking elderly woman in the usual peasant dresswhite
undergarment with long double apron front and back of coloured stuff
fitting almost too tight for modesty when i came close she bowed and
said the herr englishman yes i said jonathan harker she
smiled and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirtsleeves
who had followed her to the door he went but immediately returned with
a letter

     my friendwelcome to the carpathians i am anxiously expecting
     you sleep well tonight at three tomorrow the diligence will
     start for bukovina a place on it is kept for you at the borgo
     pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me i trust
     that your journey from london has been a happy one and that you
     will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land

your friend

dracula


 mayi found that my landlord had got a letter from the count
directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me but on
making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent and
pretended that he could not understand my german this could not be
true because up to then he had understood it perfectly at least he
answered my questions exactly as if he did he and his wife the old
lady who had received me looked at each other in a frightened sort of
way he mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter and that
was all he knew when i asked him if he knew count dracula and could
tell me anything of his castle both he and his wife crossed themselves
and saying that they knew nothing at all simply refused to speak
further it was so near the time of starting that i had no time to ask
any one else for it was all very mysterious and not by any means
comforting

just before i was leaving the old lady came up to my room and said in a
very hysterical way

must you go oh young herr must you go she was in such an excited
state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what german she knew and
mixed it all up with some other language which i did not know at all i
was just able to follow her by asking many questions when i told her
that i must go at once and that i was engaged on important business
she asked again

do you know what day it is i answered that it was the fourth of may
she shook her head as she said again

oh yes i know that i know that but do you know what day it is on
my saying that i did not understand she went on

it is the eve of st georges day do you not know that tonight when
the clock strikes midnight all the evil things in the world will have
full sway do you know where you are going and what you are going to
she was in such evident distress that i tried to comfort her but
without effect finally she went down on her knees and implored me not
to go at least to wait a day or two before starting it was all very
ridiculous but i did not feel comfortable however there was business
to be done and i could allow nothing to interfere with it i therefore
tried to raise her up and said as gravely as i could that i thanked
her but my duty was imperative and that i must go she then rose and
dried her eyes and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me i
did not know what to do for as an english churchman i have been
taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous and yet it
seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a
state of mind she saw i suppose the doubt in my face for she put the
rosary round my neck and said for your mothers sake and went out
of the room i am writing up this part of the diary whilst i am waiting
for the coach which is of course late and the crucifix is still
round my neck whether it is the old ladys fear or the many ghostly
traditions of this place or the crucifix itself i do not know but i
am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual if this book should
ever reach mina before i do let it bring my goodbye here comes the
coach

                                   

 may the castlethe grey of the morning has passed and the sun is
high over the distant horizon which seems jagged whether with trees or
hills i know not for it is so far off that big things and little are
mixed i am not sleepy and as i am not to be called till i awake
naturally i write till sleep comes there are many odd things to put
down and lest who reads them may fancy that i dined too well before i
left bistritz let me put down my dinner exactly i dined on what they
called robber steakbits of bacon onion and beef seasoned with red
pepper and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire in the simple
style of the london cats meat the wine was golden mediasch which
produces a queer sting on the tongue which is however not
disagreeable i had only a couple of glasses of this and nothing else

when i got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat and i saw him
talking with the landlady they were evidently talking of me for every
now and then they looked at me and some of the people who were sitting
on the bench outside the doorwhich they call by a name meaning
wordbearercame and listened and then looked at me most of them
pityingly i could hear a lot of words often repeated queer words for
there were many nationalities in the crowd so i quietly got my polyglot
dictionary from my bag and looked them out i must say they were not
cheering to me for amongst them were ordogsatan pokolhell
stregoicawitch vrolok and vlkoslakboth of which mean the same
thing one being slovak and the other servian for something that is
either werewolf or vampire mem i must ask the count about these
superstitions

when we started the crowd round the inn door which had by this time
swelled to a considerable size all made the sign of the cross and
pointed two fingers towards me with some difficulty i got a
fellowpassenger to tell me what they meant he would not answer at
first but on learning that i was english he explained that it was a
charm or guard against the evil eye this was not very pleasant for me
just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man but every one
seemed so kindhearted and so sorrowful and so sympathetic that i
could not but be touched i shall never forget the last glimpse which i
had of the innyard and its crowd of picturesque figures all crossing
themselves as they stood round the wide archway with its background of
rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the
centre of the yard then our driver whose wide linen drawers covered
the whole front of the boxseatgotza they call themcracked his big
whip over his four small horses which ran abreast and we set off on
our journey

i soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the
scene as we drove along although had i known the language or rather
languages which my fellowpassengers were speaking i might not have
been able to throw them off so easily before us lay a green sloping
land full of forests and woods with here and there steep hills crowned
with clumps of trees or with farmhouses the blank gable end to the
road there was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossomapple
plum pear cherry and as we drove by i could see the green grass under
the trees spangled with the fallen petals in and out amongst these
green hills of what they call here the mittel land ran the road
losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve or was shut out by the
straggling ends of pine woods which here and there ran down the
hillsides like tongues of flame the road was rugged but still we
seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste i could not understand then
what the haste meant but the driver was evidently bent on losing no
time in reaching borgo prund i was told that this road is in summertime
excellent but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter
snows in this respect it is different from the general run of roads in
the carpathians for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept
in too good order of old the hospadars would not repair them lest the
turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops
and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point

beyond the green swelling hills of the mittel land rose mighty slopes
of forest up to the lofty steeps of the carpathians themselves right
and left of us they towered with the afternoon sun falling full upon
them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range
deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks green and brown where
grass and rock mingled and an endless perspective of jagged rock and
pointed crags till these were themselves lost in the distance where
the snowy peaks rose grandly here and there seemed mighty rifts in the
mountains through which as the sun began to sink we saw now and again
the white gleam of falling water one of my companions touched my arm as
we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty snowcovered
peak of a mountain which seemed as we wound on our serpentine way to
be right before us

look isten szekgods seatand he crossed himself reverently

as we wound on our endless way and the sun sank lower and lower behind
us the shadows of the evening began to creep round us this was
emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountaintop still held the
sunset and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink here and there
we passed cszeks and slovaks all in picturesque attire but i noticed
that goitre was painfully prevalent by the roadside were many crosses
and as we swept by my companions all crossed themselves here and there
was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine who did not even
turn round as we approached but seemed in the selfsurrender of
devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world there were
many things new to me for instance hayricks in the trees and here
and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch their white stems
shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves now and
again we passed a leiterwagonthe ordinary peasants cartwith its
long snakelike vertebra calculated to suit the inequalities of the
road on this were sure to be seated quite a group of homecoming
peasants the cszeks with their white and the slovaks with their
coloured sheepskins the latter carrying lancefashion their long
staves with axe at end as the evening fell it began to get very cold
and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the
gloom of the trees oak beech and pine though in the valleys which
ran deep between the spurs of the hills as we ascended through the
pass the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of
latelying snow sometimes as the road was cut through the pine woods
that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us great masses of
greyness which here and there bestrewed the trees produced a
peculiarly weird and solemn effect which carried on the thoughts and
grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening when the falling sunset
threw into strange relief the ghostlike clouds which amongst the
carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys sometimes the
hills were so steep that despite our drivers haste the horses could
only go slowly i wished to get down and walk up them as we do at home
but the driver would not hear of it no no he said you must not
walk here the dogs are too fierce and then he added with what he
evidently meant for grim pleasantryfor he looked round to catch the
approving smile of the restand you may have enough of such matters
before you go to sleep the only stop he would make was a moments
pause to light his lamps

when it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the
passengers and they kept speaking to him one after the other as
though urging him to further speed he lashed the horses unmercifully
with his long whip and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on
to further exertions then through the darkness i could see a sort of
patch of grey light ahead of us as though there were a cleft in the
hills the excitement of the passengers grew greater the crazy coach
rocked on its great leather springs and swayed like a boat tossed on a
stormy sea i had to hold on the road grew more level and we appeared
to fly along then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each
side and to frown down upon us we were entering on the borgo pass one
by one several of the passengers offered me gifts which they pressed
upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial these were
certainly of an odd and varied kind but each was given in simple good
faith with a kindly word and a blessing and that strange mixture of
fearmeaning movements which i had seen outside the hotel at
bistritzthe sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye
then as we flew along the driver leaned forward and on each side the
passengers craning over the edge of the coach peered eagerly into the
darkness it was evident that something very exciting was either
happening or expected but though i asked each passenger no one would
give me the slightest explanation this state of excitement kept on for
some little time and at last we saw before us the pass opening out on
the eastern side there were dark rolling clouds overhead and in the
air the heavy oppressive sense of thunder it seemed as though the
mountain range had separated two atmospheres and that now we had got
into the thunderous one i was now myself looking out for the conveyance
which was to take me to the count each moment i expected to see the
glare of lamps through the blackness but all was dark the only light
was the flickering rays of our own lamps in which the steam from our
harddriven horses rose in a white cloud we could see now the sandy
road lying white before us but there was on it no sign of a vehicle
the passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness which seemed to mock
my own disappointment i was already thinking what i had best do when
the driver looking at his watch said to the others something which i
could hardly hear it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone i
thought it was an hour less than the time then turning to me he said
in german worse than my own

there is no carriage here the herr is not expected after all he will
now come on to bukovina and return tomorrow or the next day better
the next day whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and
snort and plunge wildly so that the driver had to hold them up then
amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing
of themselves a caleche with four horses drove up behind us overtook
us and drew up beside the coach i could see from the flash of our
lamps as the rays fell on them that the horses were coalblack and
splendid animals they were driven by a tall man with a long brown
beard and a great black hat which seemed to hide his face from us i
could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes which seemed red
in the lamplight as he turned to us he said to the driver

you are early tonight my friend the man stammered in reply

the english herr was in a hurry to which the stranger replied

that is why i suppose you wished him to go on to bukovina you cannot
deceive me my friend i know too much and my horses are swift as he
spoke he smiled and the lamplight fell on a hardlooking mouth with
very red lips and sharplooking teeth as white as ivory one of my
companions whispered to another the line from burgers lenore

    denn die todten reiten schnell
    for the dead travel fast

the strange driver evidently heard the words for he looked up with a
gleaming smile the passenger turned his face away at the same time
putting out his two fingers and crossing himself give me the herrs
luggage said the driver and with exceeding alacrity my bags were
handed out and put in the caleche then i descended from the side of the
coach as the caleche was close alongside the driver helping me with a
hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel his strength must have been
prodigious without a word he shook his reins the horses turned and we
swept into the darkness of the pass as i looked back i saw the steam
from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps and projected
against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves then
the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses and off they swept
on their way to bukovina as they sank into the darkness i felt a
strange chill and a lonely feeling came over me but a cloak was thrown
over my shoulders and a rug across my knees and the driver said in
excellent german

the night is chill mein herr and my master the count bade me take all
care of you there is a flask of slivovitz the plum brandy of the
country underneath the seat if you should require it i did not take
any but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same i felt a
little strangely and not a little frightened i think had there been
any alternative i should have taken it instead of prosecuting that
unknown night journey the carriage went at a hard pace straight along
then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road it
seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground
again and so i took note of some salient point and found that this was
so i would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant but
i really feared to do so for i thought that placed as i was any
protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to
delay byandby however as i was curious to know how time was
passing i struck a match and by its flame looked at my watch it was
within a few minutes of midnight this gave me a sort of shock for i
suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my
recent experiences i waited with a sick feeling of suspense

then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the roada
long agonised wailing as if from fear the sound was taken up by
another dog and then another and another till borne on the wind which
now sighed softly through the pass a wild howling began which seemed
to come from all over the country as far as the imagination could grasp
it through the gloom of the night at the first howl the horses began to
strain and rear but the driver spoke to them soothingly and they
quieted down but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from
sudden fright then far off in the distance from the mountains on each
side of us began a louder and a sharper howlingthat of wolveswhich
affected both the horses and myself in the same wayfor i was minded to
jump from the caleche and run whilst they reared again and plunged
madly so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them
from bolting in a few minutes however my own ears got accustomed to
the sound and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able
to descend and to stand before them he petted and soothed them and
whispered something in their ears as i have heard of horsetamers
doing and with extraordinary effect for under his caresses they became
quite manageable again though they still trembled the driver again
took his seat and shaking his reins started off at a great pace this
time after going to the far side of the pass he suddenly turned down a
narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right

soon we were hemmed in with trees which in places arched right over the
roadway till we passed as through a tunnel and again great frowning
rocks guarded us boldly on either side though we were in shelter we
could hear the rising wind for it moaned and whistled through the
rocks and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along
it grew colder and colder still and fine powdery snow began to fall
so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket the
keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs though this grew
fainter as we went on our way the baying of the wolves sounded nearer
and nearer as though they were closing round on us from every side i
grew dreadfully afraid and the horses shared my fear the driver
however was not in the least disturbed he kept turning his head to
left and right but i could not see anything through the darkness

suddenly away on our left i saw a faint flickering blue flame the
driver saw it at the same moment he at once checked the horses and
jumping to the ground disappeared into the darkness i did not know
what to do the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer but while
i wondered the driver suddenly appeared again and without a word took
his seat and we resumed our journey i think i must have fallen asleep
and kept dreaming of the incident for it seemed to be repeated
endlessly and now looking back it is like a sort of awful nightmare
once the flame appeared so near the road that even in the darkness
around us i could watch the drivers motions he went rapidly to where
the blue flame aroseit must have been very faint for it did not seem
to illumine the place around it at alland gathering a few stones
formed them into some device once there appeared a strange optical
effect when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it
for i could see its ghostly flicker all the same this startled me but
as the effect was only momentary i took it that my eyes deceived me
straining through the darkness then for a time there were no blue
flames and we sped onwards through the gloom with the howling of the
wolves around us as though they were following in a moving circle

at last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he
had yet gone and during his absence the horses began to tremble worse
than ever and to snort and scream with fright i could not see any cause
for it for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether but just
then the moon sailing through the black clouds appeared behind the
jagged crest of a beetling pineclad rock and by its light i saw
around us a ring of wolves with white teeth and lolling red tongues
with long sinewy limbs and shaggy hair they were a hundred times more
terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled
for myself i felt a sort of paralysis of fear it is only when a man
feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand
their true import

all at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had
some peculiar effect on them the horses jumped about and reared and
looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see
but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side and they
had perforce to remain within it i called to the coachman to come for
it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the
ring and to aid his approach i shouted and beat the side of the
caleche hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side so as
to give him a chance of reaching the trap how he came there i know
not but i heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command and
looking towards the sound saw him stand in the roadway as he swept his
long arms as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle the wolves
fell back and back further still just then a heavy cloud passed across
the face of the moon so that we were again in darkness

when i could see again the driver was climbing into the caleche and the
wolves had disappeared this was all so strange and uncanny that a
dreadful fear came upon me and i was afraid to speak or move the time
seemed interminable as we swept on our way now in almost complete
darkness for the rolling clouds obscured the moon we kept on
ascending with occasional periods of quick descent but in the main
always ascending suddenly i became conscious of the fact that the
driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a
vast ruined castle from whose tall black windows came no ray of light
and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit
sky




chapter ii

jonathan harkers journalcontinued


 mayi must have been asleep for certainly if i had been fully
awake i must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place in
the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size and as several dark
ways led from it under great round arches it perhaps seemed bigger than
it really is i have not yet been able to see it by daylight

when the caleche stopped the driver jumped down and held out his hand
to assist me to alight again i could not but notice his prodigious
strength his hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have
crushed mine if he had chosen then he took out my traps and placed
them on the ground beside me as i stood close to a great door old and
studded with large iron nails and set in a projecting doorway of
massive stone i could see even in the dim light that the stone was
massively carved but that the carving had been much worn by time and
weather as i stood the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the
reins the horses started forward and trap and all disappeared down one
of the dark openings

i stood in silence where i was for i did not know what to do of bell
or knocker there was no sign through these frowning walls and dark
window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate the
time i waited seemed endless and i felt doubts and fears crowding upon
me what sort of place had i come to and among what kind of people
what sort of grim adventure was it on which i had embarked was this a
customary incident in the life of a solicitors clerk sent out to
explain the purchase of a london estate to a foreigner solicitors
clerk mina would not like that solicitorfor just before leaving
london i got word that my examination was successful and i am now a
fullblown solicitor i began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if
i were awake it all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me and i
expected that i should suddenly awake and find myself at home with
the dawn struggling in through the windows as i had now and again felt
in the morning after a day of overwork but my flesh answered the
pinching test and my eyes were not to be deceived i was indeed awake
and among the carpathians all i could do now was to be patient and to
wait the coming of the morning

just as i had come to this conclusion i heard a heavy step approaching
behind the great door and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming
light then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of
massive bolts drawn back a key was turned with the loud grating noise
of long disuse and the great door swung back

within stood a tall old man clean shaven save for a long white
moustache and clad in black from head to foot without a single speck
of colour about him anywhere he held in his hand an antique silver
lamp in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind
throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the
open door the old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly
gesture saying in excellent english but with a strange intonation

welcome to my house enter freely and of your own will he made no
motion of stepping to meet me but stood like a statue as though his
gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone the instant however that
i had stepped over the threshold he moved impulsively forward and
holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince
an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as
icemore like the hand of a dead than a living man again he said

welcome to my house come freely go safely and leave something of the
happiness you bring the strength of the handshake was so much akin to
that which i had noticed in the driver whose face i had not seen that
for a moment i doubted if it were not the same person to whom i was
speaking so to make sure i said interrogatively

count dracula he bowed in a courtly way as he replied

i am dracula and i bid you welcome mr harker to my house come in
the night air is chill and you must need to eat and rest as he was
speaking he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall and stepping out
took my luggage he had carried it in before i could forestall him i
protested but he insisted

nay sir you are my guest it is late and my people are not
available let me see to your comfort myself he insisted on carrying
my traps along the passage and then up a great winding stair and
along another great passage on whose stone floor our steps rang
heavily at the end of this he threw open a heavy door and i rejoiced
to see within a welllit room in which a table was spread for supper
and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs freshly replenished
flamed and flared

the count halted putting down my bags closed the door and crossing
the room opened another door which led into a small octagonal room lit
by a single lamp and seemingly without a window of any sort passing
through this he opened another door and motioned me to enter it was a
welcome sight for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with
another log firealso added to but lately for the top logs were
freshwhich sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney the count himself
left my luggage inside and withdrew saying before he closed the
door

you will need after your journey to refresh yourself by making your
toilet i trust you will find all you wish when you are ready come
into the other room where you will find your supper prepared

the light and warmth and the counts courteous welcome seemed to have
dissipated all my doubts and fears having then reached my normal state
i discovered that i was half famished with hunger so making a hasty
toilet i went into the other room

i found supper already laid out my host who stood on one side of the
great fireplace leaning against the stonework made a graceful wave of
his hand to the table and said

i pray you be seated and sup how you please you will i trust excuse
me that i do not join you but i have dined already and i do not sup

i handed to him the sealed letter which mr hawkins had entrusted to me
he opened it and read it gravely then with a charming smile he handed
it to me to read one passage of it at least gave me a thrill of
pleasure

i must regret that an attack of gout from which malady i am a constant
sufferer forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to
come but i am happy to say i can send a sufficient substitute one in
whom i have every possible confidence he is a young man full of energy
and talent in his own way and of a very faithful disposition he is
discreet and silent and has grown into manhood in my service he shall
be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay and shall take
your instructions in all matters

the count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish and i
fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken this with some cheese
and a salad and a bottle of old tokay of which i had two glasses was
my supper during the time i was eating it the count asked me many
questions as to my journey and i told him by degrees all i had
experienced

by this time i had finished my supper and by my hosts desire had drawn
up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me
at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke i had now an
opportunity of observing him and found him of a very marked
physiognomy

his face was a stronga very strongaquiline with high bridge of the
thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils with lofty domed forehead and
hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere his
eyebrows were very massive almost meeting over the nose and with bushy
hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion the mouth so far as i
could see it under the heavy moustache was fixed and rather
cruellooking with peculiarly sharp white teeth these protruded over
the lips whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a
man of his years for the rest his ears were pale and at the tops
extremely pointed the chin was broad and strong and the cheeks firm
though thin the general effect was one of extraordinary pallor

hitherto i had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees
in the firelight and they had seemed rather white and fine but seeing
them now close to me i could not but notice that they were rather
coarsebroad with squat fingers strange to say there were hairs in
the centre of the palm the nails were long and fine and cut to a sharp
point as the count leaned over me and his hands touched me i could not
repress a shudder it may have been that his breath was rank but a
horrible feeling of nausea came over me which do what i would i could
not conceal the count evidently noticing it drew back and with a
grim sort of smile which showed more than he had yet done his
protuberant teeth sat himself down again on his own side of the
fireplace we were both silent for a while and as i looked towards the
window i saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn there seemed a
strange stillness over everything but as i listened i heard as if from
down below in the valley the howling of many wolves the counts eyes
gleamed and he said

listen to themthe children of the night what music they make
seeing i suppose some expression in my face strange to him he
added

ah sir you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the
hunter then he rose and said

but you must be tired your bedroom is all ready and tomorrow you
shall sleep as late as you will i have to be away till the afternoon
so sleep well and dream well with a courteous bow he opened for me
himself the door to the octagonal room and i entered my bedroom

i am all in a sea of wonders i doubt i fear i think strange things
which i dare not confess to my own soul god keep me if only for the
sake of those dear to me

                                   

 mayit is again early morning but i have rested and enjoyed the
last twentyfour hours i slept till late in the day and awoke of my
own accord when i had dressed myself i went into the room where we had
supped and found a cold breakfast laid out with coffee kept hot by the
pot being placed on the hearth there was a card on the table on which
was written

i have to be absent for a while do not wait for med i set to and
enjoyed a hearty meal when i had done i looked for a bell so that i
might let the servants know i had finished but i could not find one
there are certainly odd deficiencies in the house considering the
extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me the table service
is of gold and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value
the curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of
my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics and must have
been of fabulous value when they were made for they are centuries old
though in excellent order i saw something like them in hampton court
but there they were worn and frayed and motheaten but still in none of
the rooms is there a mirror there is not even a toilet glass on my
table and i had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before i
could either shave or brush my hair i have not yet seen a servant
anywhere or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves
some time after i had finished my meali do not know whether to call it
breakfast or dinner for it was between five and six oclock when i had
iti looked about for something to read for i did not like to go about
the castle until i had asked the counts permission there was
absolutely nothing in the room book newspaper or even writing
materials so i opened another door in the room and found a sort of
library the door opposite mine i tried but found it locked

in the library i found to my great delight a vast number of english
books whole shelves full of them and bound volumes of magazines and
newspapers a table in the centre was littered with english magazines
and newspapers though none of them were of very recent date the books
were of the most varied kindhistory geography politics political
economy botany geology lawall relating to england and english life
and customs and manners there were even such books of reference as the
london directory the red and blue books whitakers almanac the
army and navy lists andit somehow gladdened my heart to see itthe
law list

whilst i was looking at the books the door opened and the count
entered he saluted me in a hearty way and hoped that i had had a good
nights rest then he went on

i am glad you found your way in here for i am sure there is much that
will interest you these companionsand he laid his hand on some of
the bookshave been good friends to me and for some years past ever
since i had the idea of going to london have given me many many hours
of pleasure through them i have come to know your great england and to
know her is to love her i long to go through the crowded streets of
your mighty london to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of
humanity to share its life its change its death and all that makes
it what it is but alas as yet i only know your tongue through books
to you my friend i look that i know it to speak

but count i said you know and speak english thoroughly he bowed
gravely

i thank you my friend for your all tooflattering estimate but yet i
fear that i am but a little way on the road i would travel true i know
the grammar and the words but yet i know not how to speak them

indeed i said you speak excellently

not so he answered well i know that did i move and speak in your
london none there are who would not know me for a stranger that is not
enough for me here i am noble i am boyar the common people know me
and i am master but a stranger in a strange land he is no one men
know him notand to know not is to care not for i am content if i am
like the rest so that no man stops if he see me or pause in his
speaking if he hear my words ha ha a stranger i have been so long
master that i would be master stillor at least that none other should
be master of me you come to me not alone as agent of my friend peter
hawkins of exeter to tell me all about my new estate in london you
shall i trust rest here with me awhile so that by our talking i may
learn the english intonation and i would that you tell me when i make
error even of the smallest in my speaking i am sorry that i had to be
away so long today but you will i know forgive one who has so many
important affairs in hand

of course i said all i could about being willing and asked if i might
come into that room when i chose he answered yes certainly and
added

you may go anywhere you wish in the castle except where the doors are
locked where of course you will not wish to go there is reason that
all things are as they are and did you see with my eyes and know with
my knowledge you would perhaps better understand i said i was sure of
this and then he went on

we are in transylvania and transylvania is not england our ways are
not your ways and there shall be to you many strange things nay from
what you have told me of your experiences already you know something of
what strange things there may be

this led to much conversation and as it was evident that he wanted to
talk if only for talkings sake i asked him many questions regarding
things that had already happened to me or come within my notice
sometimes he sheered off the subject or turned the conversation by
pretending not to understand but generally he answered all i asked most
frankly then as time went on and i had got somewhat bolder i asked
him of some of the strange things of the preceding night as for
instance why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue
flames he then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a
certain night of the yearlast night in fact when all evil spirits
are supposed to have unchecked swaya blue flame is seen over any place
where treasure has been concealed that treasure has been hidden he
went on in the region through which you came last night there can be
but little doubt for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the
wallachian the saxon and the turk why there is hardly a foot of soil
in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men
patriots or invaders in old days there were stirring times when the
austrian and the hungarian came up in hordes and the patriots went out
to meet themmen and women the aged and the children tooand waited
their coming on the rocks above the passes that they might sweep
destruction on them with their artificial avalanches when the invader
was triumphant he found but little for whatever there was had been
sheltered in the friendly soil

but how said i can it have remained so long undiscovered when
there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look
the count smiled and as his lips ran back over his gums the long
sharp canine teeth showed out strangely he answered

because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool those flames only
appear on one night and on that night no man of this land will if he
can help it stir without his doors and dear sir even if he did he
would not know what to do why even the peasant that you tell me of who
marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight
even for his own work even you would not i dare be sworn be able to
find these places again

there you are right i said i know no more than the dead where even
to look for them then we drifted into other matters

come he said at last tell me of london and of the house which you
have procured for me with an apology for my remissness i went into my
own room to get the papers from my bag whilst i was placing them in
order i heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room and as i
passed through noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp
lit for it was by this time deep into the dark the lamps were also lit
in the study or library and i found the count lying on the sofa
reading of all things in the world an english bradshaws guide when i
came in he cleared the books and papers from the table and with him i
went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts he was interested in
everything and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its
surroundings he clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the
subject of the neighbourhood for he evidently at the end knew very much
more than i did when i remarked this he answered

well but my friend is it not needful that i should when i go there
i shall be all alone and my friend harker jonathannay pardon me i
fall into my countrys habit of putting your patronymic firstmy friend
jonathan harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me he will be
in exeter miles away probably working at papers of the law with my
other friend peter hawkins so

we went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at
purfleet when i had told him the facts and got his signature to the
necessary papers and had written a letter with them ready to post to
mr hawkins he began to ask me how i had come across so suitable a
place i read to him the notes which i had made at the time and which i
inscribe here

at purfleet on a byroad i came across just such a place as seemed to
be required and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place
was for sale it is surrounded by a high wall of ancient structure
built of heavy stones and has not been repaired for a large number of
years the closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron all eaten with
rust

the estate is called carfax no doubt a corruption of the old quatre
face as the house is foursided agreeing with the cardinal points of
the compass it contains in all some twenty acres quite surrounded by
the solid stone wall above mentioned there are many trees on it which
make it in places gloomy and there is a deep darklooking pond or
small lake evidently fed by some springs as the water is clear and
flows away in a fairsized stream the house is very large and of all
periods back i should say to medieval times for one part is of stone
immensely thick with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with
iron it looks like part of a keep and is close to an old chapel or
church i could not enter it as i had not the key of the door leading
to it from the house but i have taken with my kodak views of it from
various points the house has been added to but in a very straggling
way and i can only guess at the amount of ground it covers which must
be very great there are but few houses close at hand one being a very
large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic
asylum it is not however visible from the grounds

when i had finished he said

i am glad that it is old and big i myself am of an old family and to
live in a new house would kill me a house cannot be made habitable in a
day and after all how few days go to make up a century i rejoice
also that there is a chapel of old times we transylvanian nobles love
not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead i seek not
gaiety nor mirth not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and
sparkling waters which please the young and gay i am no longer young
and my heart through weary years of mourning over the dead is not
attuned to mirth moreover the walls of my castle are broken the
shadows are many and the wind breathes cold through the broken
battlements and casements i love the shade and the shadow and would
be alone with my thoughts when i may somehow his words and his look
did not seem to accord or else it was that his cast of face made his
smile look malignant and saturnine

presently with an excuse he left me asking me to put all my papers
together he was some little time away and i began to look at some of
the books around me one was an atlas which i found opened naturally at
england as if that map had been much used on looking at it i found in
certain places little rings marked and on examining these i noticed
that one was near london on the east side manifestly where his new
estate was situated the other two were exeter and whitby on the
yorkshire coast

it was the better part of an hour when the count returned aha he
said still at your books good but you must not work always come i
am informed that your supper is ready he took my arm and we went into
the next room where i found an excellent supper ready on the table the
count again excused himself as he had dined out on his being away from
home but he sat as on the previous night and chatted whilst i ate
after supper i smoked as on the last evening and the count stayed with
me chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject hour
after hour i felt that it was getting very late indeed but i did not
say anything for i felt under obligation to meet my hosts wishes in
every way i was not sleepy as the long sleep yesterday had fortified
me but i could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at
the coming of the dawn which is like in its way the turn of the tide
they say that people who are near death die generally at the change to
the dawn or at the turn of the tide any one who has when tired and
tied as it were to his post experienced this change in the atmosphere
can well believe it all at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up
with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air count
dracula jumping to his feet said

why there is the morning again how remiss i am to let you stay up so
long you must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of
england less interesting so that i may not forget how time flies by
us and with a courtly bow he quickly left me

i went into my own room and drew the curtains but there was little to
notice my window opened into the courtyard all i could see was the
warm grey of quickening sky so i pulled the curtains again and have
written of this day

                                   

 mayi began to fear as i wrote in this book that i was getting too
diffuse but now i am glad that i went into detail from the first for
there is something so strange about this place and all in it that i
cannot but feel uneasy i wish i were safe out of it or that i had
never come it may be that this strange nightexistence is telling on
me but would that that were all if there were any one to talk to i
could bear it but there is no one i have only the count to speak with
and hei fear i am myself the only living soul within the place let
me be prosaic so far as facts can be it will help me to bear up and
imagination must not run riot with me if it does i am lost let me say
at once how i standor seem to

i only slept a few hours when i went to bed and feeling that i could
not sleep any more got up i had hung my shaving glass by the window
and was just beginning to shave suddenly i felt a hand on my shoulder
and heard the counts voice saying to me goodmorning i started for
it amazed me that i had not seen him since the reflection of the glass
covered the whole room behind me in starting i had cut myself slightly
but did not notice it at the moment having answered the counts
salutation i turned to the glass again to see how i had been mistaken
this time there could be no error for the man was close to me and i
could see him over my shoulder but there was no reflection of him in
the mirror the whole room behind me was displayed but there was no
sign of a man in it except myself this was startling and coming on
the top of so many strange things was beginning to increase that vague
feeling of uneasiness which i always have when the count is near but at
the instant i saw that the cut had bled a little and the blood was
trickling over my chin i laid down the razor turning as i did so half
round to look for some sticking plaster when the count saw my face his
eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury and he suddenly made a grab at
my throat i drew away and his hand touched the string of beads which
held the crucifix it made an instant change in him for the fury passed
so quickly that i could hardly believe that it was ever there

take care he said take care how you cut yourself it is more
dangerous than you think in this country then seizing the shaving
glass he went on and this is the wretched thing that has done the
mischief it is a foul bauble of mans vanity away with it and
opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand he flung
out the glass which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones
of the courtyard far below then he withdrew without a word it is very
annoying for i do not see how i am to shave unless in my watchcase or
the bottom of the shavingpot which is fortunately of metal

when i went into the diningroom breakfast was prepared but i could
not find the count anywhere so i breakfasted alone it is strange that
as yet i have not seen the count eat or drink he must be a very
peculiar man after breakfast i did a little exploring in the castle i
went out on the stairs and found a room looking towards the south the
view was magnificent and from where i stood there was every opportunity
of seeing it the castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice a
stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without
touching anything as far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree
tops with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm here and
there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through
the forests

but i am not in heart to describe beauty for when i had seen the view i
explored further doors doors doors everywhere and all locked and
bolted in no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there
an available exit

the castle is a veritable prison and i am a prisoner




chapter iii

jonathan harkers journalcontinued


when i found that i was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me
i rushed up and down the stairs trying every door and peering out of
every window i could find but after a little the conviction of my
helplessness overpowered all other feelings when i look back after a
few hours i think i must have been mad for the time for i behaved much
as a rat does in a trap when however the conviction had come to me
that i was helpless i sat down quietlyas quietly as i have ever done
anything in my lifeand began to think over what was best to be done i
am thinking still and as yet have come to no definite conclusion of
one thing only am i certain that it is no use making my ideas known to
the count he knows well that i am imprisoned and as he has done it
himself and has doubtless his own motives for it he would only deceive
me if i trusted him fully with the facts so far as i can see my only
plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself and my eyes
open i am i know either being deceived like a baby by my own fears
or else i am in desperate straits and if the latter be so i need and
shall need all my brains to get through

i had hardly come to this conclusion when i heard the great door below
shut and knew that the count had returned he did not come at once into
the library so i went cautiously to my own room and found him making
the bed this was odd but only confirmed what i had all along
thoughtthat there were no servants in the house when later i saw him
through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the
diningroom i was assured of it for if he does himself all these
menial offices surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them
this gave me a fright for if there is no one else in the castle it
must have been the count himself who was the driver of the coach that
brought me here this is a terrible thought for if so what does it
mean that he could control the wolves as he did by only holding up his
hand in silence how was it that all the people at bistritz and on the
coach had some terrible fear for me what meant the giving of the
crucifix of the garlic of the wild rose of the mountain ash bless
that good good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck for it is a
comfort and a strength to me whenever i touch it it is odd that a thing
which i have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous
should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help is it that there
is something in the essence of the thing itself or that it is a medium
a tangible help in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort some
time if it may be i must examine this matter and try to make up my
mind about it in the meantime i must find out all i can about count
dracula as it may help me to understand tonight he may talk of
himself if i turn the conversation that way i must be very careful
however not to awake his suspicion

                                   

midnighti have had a long talk with the count i asked him a few
questions on transylvania history and he warmed up to the subject
wonderfully in his speaking of things and people and especially of
battles he spoke as if he had been present at them all this he
afterwards explained by saying that to a boyar the pride of his house
and name is his own pride that their glory is his glory that their
fate is his fate whenever he spoke of his house he always said we
and spoke almost in the plural like a king speaking i wish i could put
down all he said exactly as he said it for to me it was most
fascinating it seemed to have in it a whole history of the country he
grew excited as he spoke and walked about the room pulling his great
white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as
though he would crush it by main strength one thing he said which i
shall put down as nearly as i can for it tells in its way the story of
his race

we szekelys have a right to be proud for in our veins flows the blood
of many brave races who fought as the lion fights for lordship here
in the whirlpool of european races the ugric tribe bore down from
iceland the fighting spirit which thor and wodin gave them which their
berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of europe ay
and of asia and africa too till the peoples thought that the
werewolves themselves had come here too when they came they found
the huns whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame
till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those
old witches who expelled from scythia had mated with the devils in the
desert fools fools what devil or what witch was ever so great as
attila whose blood is in these veins he held up his arms is it a
wonder that we were a conquering race that we were proud that when the
magyar the lombard the avar the bulgar or the turk poured his
thousands on our frontiers we drove them back is it strange that when
arpad and his legions swept through the hungarian fatherland he found us
here when he reached the frontier that the honfoglalas was completed
there and when the hungarian flood swept eastward the szekelys were
claimed as kindred by the victorious magyars and to us for centuries
was trusted the guarding of the frontier of turkeyland ay and more
than that endless duty of the frontier guard for as the turks say
water sleeps and enemy is sleepless who more gladly than we
throughout the four nations received the bloody sword or at its
warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the king when was
redeemed that great shame of my nation the shame of cassova when the
flags of the wallach and the magyar went down beneath the crescent who
was it but one of my own race who as voivode crossed the danube and beat
the turk on his own ground this was a dracula indeed woe was it that
his own unworthy brother when he had fallen sold his people to the
turk and brought the shame of slavery on them was it not this dracula
indeed who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and
again brought his forces over the great river into turkeyland who
when he was beaten back came again and again and again though he had
to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being
slaughtered since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph they
said that he thought only of himself bah what good are peasants
without a leader where ends the war without a brain and heart to
conduct it again when after the battle of mohacs we threw off the
hungarian yoke we of the dracula blood were amongst their leaders for
our spirit would not brook that we were not free ah young sir the
szekelysand the dracula as their hearts blood their brains and
their swordscan boast a record that mushroom growths like the
hapsburgs and the romanoffs can never reach the warlike days are over
blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace and
the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told

it was by this time close on morning and we went to bed mem this
diary seems horribly like the beginning of the arabian nights for
everything has to break off at cockcrowor like the ghost of hamlets
father

                                   

 maylet me begin with factsbare meagre facts verified by
books and figures and of which there can be no doubt i must not
confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own
observation or my memory of them last evening when the count came from
his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the
doing of certain kinds of business i had spent the day wearily over
books and simply to keep my mind occupied went over some of the
matters i had been examined in at lincolns inn there was a certain
method in the counts inquiries so i shall try to put them down in
sequence the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me

first he asked if a man in england might have two solicitors or more i
told him he might have a dozen if he wished but that it would not be
wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction as only
one could act at a time and that to change would be certain to militate
against his interest he seemed thoroughly to understand and went on to
ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to
attend say to banking and another to look after shipping in case
local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking
solicitor i asked him to explain more fully so that i might not by any
chance mislead him so he said

i shall illustrate your friend and mine mr peter hawkins from under
the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at exeter which is far from
london buys for me through your good self my place at london good now
here let me say frankly lest you should think it strange that i have
sought the services of one so far off from london instead of some one
resident there that my motive was that no local interest might be
served save my wish only and as one of london residence might perhaps
have some purpose of himself or friend to serve i went thus afield to
seek my agent whose labours should be only to my interest now suppose
i who have much of affairs wish to ship goods say to newcastle or
durham or harwich or dover might it not be that it could with more
ease be done by consigning to one in these ports i answered that
certainly it would be most easy but that we solicitors had a system of
agency one for the other so that local work could be done locally on
instruction from any solicitor so that the client simply placing
himself in the hands of one man could have his wishes carried out by
him without further trouble

but said he i could be at liberty to direct myself is it not so

of course i replied and such is often done by men of business who
do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person

good he said and then went on to ask about the means of making
consignments and the forms to be gone through and of all sorts of
difficulties which might arise but by forethought could be guarded
against i explained all these things to him to the best of my ability
and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a
wonderful solicitor for there was nothing that he did not think of or
foresee for a man who was never in the country and who did not
evidently do much in the way of business his knowledge and acumen were
wonderful when he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had
spoken and i had verified all as well as i could by the books
available he suddenly stood up and said

have you written since your first letter to our friend mr peter
hawkins or to any other it was with some bitterness in my heart that
i answered that i had not that as yet i had not seen any opportunity of
sending letters to anybody

then write now my young friend he said laying a heavy hand on my
shoulder write to our friend and to any other and say if it will
please you that you shall stay with me until a month from now

do you wish me to stay so long i asked for my heart grew cold at the
thought

i desire it much nay i will take no refusal when your master
employer what you will engaged that someone should come on his behalf
it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted i have not
stinted is it not so

what could i do but bow acceptance it was mr hawkinss interest not
mine and i had to think of him not myself and besides while count
dracula was speaking there was that in his eyes and in his bearing
which made me remember that i was a prisoner and that if i wished it i
could have no choice the count saw his victory in my bow and his
mastery in the trouble of my face for he began at once to use them but
in his own smooth resistless way

i pray you my good young friend that you will not discourse of things
other than business in your letters it will doubtless please your
friends to know that you are well and that you look forward to getting
home to them is it not so as he spoke he handed me three sheets of
notepaper and three envelopes they were all of the thinnest foreign
post and looking at them then at him and noticing his quiet smile
with the sharp canine teeth lying over the red underlip i understood
as well as if he had spoken that i should be careful what i wrote for
he would be able to read it so i determined to write only formal notes
now but to write fully to mr hawkins in secret and also to mina for
to her i could write in shorthand which would puzzle the count if he
did see it when i had written my two letters i sat quiet reading a
book whilst the count wrote several notes referring as he wrote them to
some books on his table then he took up my two and placed them with his
own and put by his writing materials after which the instant the door
had closed behind him i leaned over and looked at the letters which
were face down on the table i felt no compunction in doing so for
under the circumstances i felt that i should protect myself in every way
i could

one of the letters was directed to samuel f billington no  the
crescent whitby another to herr leutner varna the third was to
coutts  co london and the fourth to herren klopstock  billreuth
bankers budapesth the second and fourth were unsealed i was just
about to look at them when i saw the doorhandle move i sank back in my
seat having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and
to resume my book before the count holding still another letter in his
hand entered the room he took up the letters on the table and stamped
them carefully and then turning to me said

i trust you will forgive me but i have much work to do in private this
evening you will i hope find all things as you wish at the door he
turned and after a moments pause said

let me advise you my dear young friendnay let me warn you with all
seriousness that should you leave these rooms you will not by any
chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle it is old and has
many memories and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely be
warned should sleep now or ever overcome you or be like to do then
haste to your own chamber or to these rooms for your rest will then be
safe but if you be not careful in this respect thenhe finished his
speech in a gruesome way for he motioned with his hands as if he were
washing them i quite understood my only doubt was as to whether any
dream could be more terrible than the unnatural horrible net of gloom
and mystery which seemed closing around me

                                   

lateri endorse the last words written but this time there is no
doubt in question i shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is
not i have placed the crucifix over the head of my bedi imagine that
my rest is thus freer from dreams and there it shall remain

when he left me i went to my room after a little while not hearing any
sound i came out and went up the stone stair to where i could look out
towards the south there was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse
inaccessible though it was to me as compared with the narrow darkness
of the courtyard looking out on this i felt that i was indeed in
prison and i seemed to want a breath of fresh air though it were of
the night i am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me
it is destroying my nerve i start at my own shadow and am full of all
sorts of horrible imaginings god knows that there is ground for my
terrible fear in this accursed place i looked out over the beautiful
expanse bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as
day in the soft light the distant hills became melted and the shadows
in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness the mere beauty seemed
to cheer me there was peace and comfort in every breath i drew as i
leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey
below me and somewhat to my left where i imagined from the order of
the rooms that the windows of the counts own room would look out the
window at which i stood was tall and deep stonemullioned and though
weatherworn was still complete but it was evidently many a day since
the case had been there i drew back behind the stonework and looked
carefully out

what i saw was the counts head coming out from the window i did not
see the face but i knew the man by the neck and the movement of his
back and arms in any case i could not mistake the hands which i had had
so many opportunities of studying i was at first interested and
somewhat amused for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest
and amuse a man when he is a prisoner but my very feelings changed to
repulsion and terror when i saw the whole man slowly emerge from the
window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss
face down with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings at
first i could not believe my eyes i thought it was some trick of the
moonlight some weird effect of shadow but i kept looking and it could
be no delusion i saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the
stones worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years and by thus
using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable
speed just as a lizard moves along a wall

what manner of man is this or what manner of creature is it in the
semblance of man i feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering
me i am in fearin awful fearand there is no escape for me i am
encompassed about with terrors that i dare not think of

                                   

 mayonce more have i seen the count go out in his lizard fashion
he moved downwards in a sidelong way some hundred feet down and a good
deal to the left he vanished into some hole or window when his head
had disappeared i leaned out to try and see more but without
availthe distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight i
knew he had left the castle now and thought to use the opportunity to
explore more than i had dared to do as yet i went back to the room and
taking a lamp tried all the doors they were all locked as i had
expected and the locks were comparatively new but i went down the
stone stairs to the hall where i had entered originally i found i could
pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains but the
door was locked and the key was gone that key must be in the counts
room i must watch should his door be unlocked so that i may get it and
escape i went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs
and passages and to try the doors that opened from them one or two
small rooms near the hall were open but there was nothing to see in
them except old furniture dusty with age and motheaten at last
however i found one door at the top of the stairway which though it
seemed to be locked gave a little under pressure i tried it harder
and found that it was not really locked but that the resistance came
from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat and the heavy door
rested on the floor here was an opportunity which i might not have
again so i exerted myself and with many efforts forced it back so that
i could enter i was now in a wing of the castle further to the right
than the rooms i knew and a storey lower down from the windows i could
see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle the
windows of the end room looking out both west and south on the latter
side as well as to the former there was a great precipice the castle
was built on the corner of a great rock so that on three sides it was
quite impregnable and great windows were placed here where sling or
bow or culverin could not reach and consequently light and comfort
impossible to a position which had to be guarded were secured to the
west was a great valley and then rising far away great jagged
mountain fastnesses rising peak on peak the sheer rock studded with
mountain ash and thorn whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and
crannies of the stone this was evidently the portion of the castle
occupied by the ladies in bygone days for the furniture had more air of
comfort than any i had seen the windows were curtainless and the
yellow moonlight flooding in through the diamond panes enabled one to
see even colours whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over
all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth my
lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight but i was
glad to have it with me for there was a dread loneliness in the place
which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble still it was better
than living alone in the rooms which i had come to hate from the
presence of the count and after trying a little to school my nerves i
found a soft quietude come over me here i am sitting at a little oak
table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen with much
thought and many blushes her illspelt loveletter and writing in my
diary in shorthand all that has happened since i closed it last it is
nineteenth century uptodate with a vengeance and yet unless my
senses deceive me the old centuries had and have powers of their own
which mere modernity cannot kill

                                   

later the morning of  maygod preserve my sanity for to this i
am reduced safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past
whilst i live on here there is but one thing to hope for that i may not
go mad if indeed i be not mad already if i be sane then surely it
is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this
hateful place the count is the least dreadful to me that to him alone i
can look for safety even though this be only whilst i can serve his
purpose great god merciful god let me be calm for out of that way
lies madness indeed i begin to get new lights on certain things which
have puzzled me up to now i never quite knew what shakespeare meant
when he made hamlet say

    my tablets quick my tablets
    tis meet that i put it down etc

for now feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock
had come which must end in its undoing i turn to my diary for repose
the habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me

the counts mysterious warning frightened me at the time it frightens
me more now when i think of it for in future he has a fearful hold upon
me i shall fear to doubt what he may say

when i had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and
pen in my pocket i felt sleepy the counts warning came into my mind
but i took a pleasure in disobeying it the sense of sleep was upon me
and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider the soft
moonlight soothed and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom
which refreshed me i determined not to return tonight to the
gloomhaunted rooms but to sleep here where of old ladies had sat
and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for
their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars i drew a great
couch out of its place near the corner so that as i lay i could look
at the lovely view to east and south and unthinking of and uncaring for
the dust composed myself for sleep i suppose i must have fallen
asleep i hope so but i fear for all that followed was startlingly
realso real that now sitting here in the broad full sunlight of the
morning i cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep

i was not alone the room was the same unchanged in any way since i
came into it i could see along the floor in the brilliant moonlight
my own footsteps marked where i had disturbed the long accumulation of
dust in the moonlight opposite me were three young women ladies by
their dress and manner i thought at the time that i must be dreaming
when i saw them for though the moonlight was behind them they threw
no shadow on the floor they came close to me and looked at me for some
time and then whispered together two were dark and had high aquiline
noses like the count and great dark piercing eyes that seemed to be
almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon the other was
fair as fair as can be with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes
like pale sapphires i seemed somehow to know her face and to know it
in connection with some dreamy fear but i could not recollect at the
moment how or where all three had brilliant white teeth that shone like
pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips there was something
about them that made me uneasy some longing and at the same time some
deadly fear i felt in my heart a wicked burning desire that they would
kiss me with those red lips it is not good to note this down lest some
day it should meet minas eyes and cause her pain but it is the truth
they whispered together and then they all three laughedsuch a
silvery musical laugh but as hard as though the sound never could have
come through the softness of human lips it was like the intolerable
tingling sweetness of waterglasses when played on by a cunning hand
the fair girl shook her head coquettishly and the other two urged her
on one said

go on you are first and we shall follow yours is the right to
begin the other added

he is young and strong there are kisses for us all i lay quiet
looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation
the fair girl advanced and bent over me till i could feel the movement
of her breath upon me sweet it was in one sense honeysweet and sent
the same tingling through the nerves as her voice but with a bitter
underlying the sweet a bitter offensiveness as one smells in blood

i was afraid to raise my eyelids but looked out and saw perfectly under
the lashes the girl went on her knees and bent over me simply
gloating there was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling
and repulsive and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips
like an animal till i could see in the moonlight the moisture shining
on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp
teeth lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of
my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat then she
paused and i could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked
her teeth and lips and could feel the hot breath on my neck then the
skin of my throat began to tingle as ones flesh does when the hand that
is to tickle it approaches nearernearer i could feel the soft
shivering touch of the lips on the supersensitive skin of my throat
and the hard dents of two sharp teeth just touching and pausing there
i closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waitedwaited with beating
heart

but at that instant another sensation swept through me as quick as
lightning i was conscious of the presence of the count and of his
being as if lapped in a storm of fury as my eyes opened involuntarily i
saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with
giants power draw it back the blue eyes transformed with fury the
white teeth champing with rage and the fair cheeks blazing red with
passion but the count never did i imagine such wrath and fury even to
the demons of the pit his eyes were positively blazing the red light
in them was lurid as if the flames of hellfire blazed behind them his
face was deathly pale and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires
the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar
of whitehot metal with a fierce sweep of his arm he hurled the woman
from him and then motioned to the others as though he were beating
them back it was the same imperious gesture that i had seen used to the
wolves in a voice which though low and almost in a whisper seemed to
cut through the air and then ring round the room he said

how dare you touch him any of you how dare you cast eyes on him when
i had forbidden it back i tell you all this man belongs to me beware
how you meddle with him or youll have to deal with me the fair girl
with a laugh of ribald coquetry turned to answer him

you yourself never loved you never love on this the other women
joined and such a mirthless hard soulless laughter rang through the
room that it almost made me faint to hear it seemed like the pleasure
of fiends then the count turned after looking at my face attentively
and said in a soft whisper

yes i too can love you yourselves can tell it from the past is it
not so well now i promise you that when i am done with him you shall
kiss him at your will now go go i must awaken him for there is work
to be done

are we to have nothing tonight said one of them with a low laugh
as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor and which
moved as though there were some living thing within it for answer he
nodded his head one of the women jumped forward and opened it if my
ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail as of a
halfsmothered child the women closed round whilst i was aghast with
horror but as i looked they disappeared and with them the dreadful
bag there was no door near them and they could not have passed me
without my noticing they simply seemed to fade into the rays of the
moonlight and pass out through the window for i could see outside the
dim shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away

then the horror overcame me and i sank down unconscious
